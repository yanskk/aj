            <h3>Caisen Teachers</h3>
            <p>Cainta Senior High School (CaiSen) is home to dedicated and skilled teachers who are committed to providing quality education. They come from various backgrounds, with some having started their teaching careers at Francisco P Felix Memorial National High School, while others joined from private schools or companies. Despite the challenges they faced in the early years, such as a shortage of seats and electric fans, the teachers remained resolute in their mission. As CaiSen gained independence, these teachers continued to serve, including Ms. Marinel Andres, Mrs. Cenecia Moreno, Mrs. Evelyn Felicia, Mr. Roy Discutido, and Mr. Jeffrie Ditablan, among many others. Some teachers, like Ms. Andres, took on leadership roles as Subject Group Heads and members of the Prefect of Discipline. Their collective efforts have contributed to the school's growth and success.</p>
